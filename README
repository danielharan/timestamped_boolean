TimestampedBoolean
==================

For an AR object called Job with a published_at field, call:

timestamped_boolean :published_at

This will create the methods published and published? which return true if the timestamp is not nil

Object.published will return a chainable has_finder which does what you would expect...

Finally, 
-publish sets the timestamp
-publish! also saves the record
-published = sets a timestamp or nil for true and false, respectively

For a field like created_at, you can specify the timestamp verb:

timestamped_boolean :created_at, :create

which will give you create and create! instead of created and created!
